PROJECT TITLE
word-guessing-and-rps

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
A college project that brings together two classic games: a word guessing game and Rock Paper Scissors. This project demonstrates key programming concepts and user interaction in Python using a console-based interface. It is designed to be easy to use and accessible for learning or entertainment purposes.

FEATURES
Play a word guessing game with automatic hints and multiple attempts.
Play the classic Rock Paper Scissors game against the computer.
Simple console interface for both games.
Input validation and friendly error messages.
Clear win/lose messages and scoring.

TECHNOLOGIES/TOOLS USED
Python (programming language)
Console/terminal for user interaction
random module from the python libraries is imported

STEPS TO INSTALL
Ensure Python is installed on your computer (Python 3.x recommended).
Clone this repository or download the code files.
Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
Run the following command to start the game:
python "JTB final code.txt"

INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING
After running the code, follow the prompt in the terminal to play each game.
Try guessing words and playing several rounds of Rock Paper Scissors.
Check if scoring, win/lose messages, and input validation work as expected.
You can change the words or rules in the code to further test or customize the games.
