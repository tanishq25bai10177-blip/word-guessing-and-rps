PROBLEM STATEMENT
Beginners and students often need accessible examples to understand basic programming concepts like user input, randomness, and control flow. This project addresses that need by combiningtwo interactive games—word guessing and Rock Paper Scissors—within a single Python program, demonstrating these principles in an engaging and practical way.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The scope covers two independent, console-based games implemented in Python. Both feature basic gameplay logic, user interaction, input validation, and scoring. The project is focused onfundamental programming concepts and does not include advanced graphics, web features, or multiplayer capabilities.

TARGET USERS
College students and programming beginners.
Learners interested in Python and simple game mechanics.
Anyone who enjoys accessible, console-based games.
People looking to improve vocabulary, cognitive skills, and strategic thinking through interactive play.
Individuals seeking fun and relaxing games that foster social interaction and mental stimulation.

HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES
